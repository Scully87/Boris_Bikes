Boris Bikes
===========

### -This is project is still in development

[Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com) week 1 project introduces us to Object-Oriented Programming and testing with RSpec. We simulated the Barclays Cycle Hire system in London with separate classes for bikes, docking stations, vans, garages, and people.

A person can rent a bike from one station and return it to another. A bike can be broken if the person has an accident. Broken bikes will not be rented out, and can be fixed when picked up by a van and taken to the garage.
