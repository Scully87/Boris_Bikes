We are building a system that manages bikes that can be rented 
by users from docking stations and returned there at the end 
of the rental. The bikes can break while being used, in which
case they will not be available for rental after they are
returned. There is a garage that can fix broken bikes. A van
is used to move broke bikes from the stations to the garage.
It can alse be used to take fixed bikes back to the station.
The van, all stations and the garage have fixed capacity, so 
they cannot take more bikes that they can hold.
